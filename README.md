Key Highlights of Project:
ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build:

Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) system that learns complex user-book interactions
Deep learning model that can predict ratings and recommend books
Complete end-to-end implementation from data loading to recommendations

ðŸ“Š The Dataset:

Book-Crossing Dataset from Kaggle with over 1 million book ratings
Three files: Books info, User demographics, and Ratings
Rich dataset perfect for demonstrating neural network capabilities

ðŸ”¬ Technical Approach:

Neural Collaborative Filtering replaces traditional matrix factorization with neural networks that can learn arbitrary functions Gilbert TannerCuriousily
Embedding layers to learn user and book representations
Deep neural network with regularization for complex pattern recognition

ðŸš€ Why This Approach is Excellent for Your Assignment:

Modern Architecture: NCF shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and performance increases as networks become deeper [1708.05031] Neural Collaborative Filtering
Clear Neural Network Demonstration: Shows embedding layers, dense layers, and how they work together
Practical Application: Recommendation systems are useful tools that businesses employ to help match customers with products they are likely to engage with Neural Network Collaborative Filtering with Amazon Book Reviews | Towards Data Science
Great Results: Neural networks with 3,050,337 trainable weights can adequately account for complex interactions, achieving MSE of 0.07 Neural Network Collaborative Filtering with Amazon Book Reviews | Towards Data Science
